To run the repo, you can activate the environment.yml or just run and install the missing package by <pip install #package_name>

The training set has been already included in the repo so you dont need to run the notebook crawl_train_dataset.ipynb again.

Create the model by running train.ipynb, the pre-trained model will automatically dowload if not downloaded yet.

Then run the test.ipynb to get the result.
